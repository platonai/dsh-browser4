title: "Browser Modes — Session, Display, and Browser Source"
description: "Decision guide for the three orthogonal choices when driving a browser with browser4-cli: which session to use (default / named / SWARM), which display mode (headless / headed / SUPERVISED), and where the browser comes from (backend-launched / attach --cdp / attach --extension) — plus the secondary knobs (profile mode, interact level, browser contexts, proxy) and the failure modes of each combination."

# Browser Modes — Session, Display, and Browser Source

Three **independent** choices decide how a browser4-cli run behaves. They are not
alternatives to each other — every run picks one value on each axis:

```
session (whose state container) × display (how it renders) × source (whose browser process)
```

| Axis | Values | Chosen by |
|---|---|---|
| **Session** | default (unnamed) · named `-s <name>` · SWARM | `goto` / `open` / `-s <name>` / `swarm create` |
| **Display** | `HEADLESS` (default) · `GUI` (`--headed`) · `SUPERVISED` | `open --headless/--headed`, `swarm create --display-mode` |
| **Source** | backend-launched · `attach --cdp` · `attach --extension` | `open` vs `attach …` |

**Recommended decision order:** source first (it decides whether you can reuse an
existing login and who owns the browser process) → session (concurrency and state
isolation) → display (whether a human must participate) → secondary knobs.

> **Two hard constraints** limit the combinations:
> 1. **SWARM always launches its own browsers.** A swarm session cannot attach to
>    an existing browser — `swarm create` only accepts
>    `--profile-mode`/`--max-open-tabs`/`--max-browser-contexts`/`--display-mode`.
> 2. **The display mode is fixed when the session is created.** Reconnecting with
>    `open --headed` on an existing session warns and ignores the flag; use
>    `close` + `open`, or `open --fresh`.

## 1. Axis 1 — Session

| | Default (unnamed) | Named `-s <name>` | SWARM |
|---|---|---|---|
| Slot | exactly one | one per name | fixed id `SWARM` |
| State file | `~/.browser4/cli-state.json` | `~/.browser4/sessions/<name>.json` | `sessions/SWARM.json` |
| Second session in the slot | **refused** (`An unnamed session already exists…`) | always allowed | reused if it already exists (create capabilities are ignored) |
| Browser profile | shared Browser4 profile (`DEFAULT`) | dedicated dir `…/context/groups/named/PULSAR_CHROME/cx.<sessionUuid>` | rotation (`SEQUENTIAL`) or one-shot (`TEMPORARY`) |
| Concurrency | singleton — two processes without `-s` **navigate each other's pages** | isolated per name; parallel-safe | parallel browser contexts + job queue |
| Interaction | full command set | full command set | jobs only: `create` / `submit` / `query` / `status` / `result` / `list` / `close` |
| Default footprint | 1 browser | 1 browser per session | 2 browser contexts × 8 tabs |

**Rules**

- Single task, sequential script, CI one-liner → **default session**.
- **Any parallelism → always pass `-s <name>`.** The unnamed slot is shared by
  every invocation that omits `-s`, and `goto` silently reconnects to it
  (last writer wins). Named sessions additionally keep their own cookies/login
  state across runs.
- `session-default <name>` promotes an existing named session into the unnamed
  slot (useful when a workflow should switch which session is "current").
- Bulk, non-interactive, throughput-oriented → **SWARM**
  (`swarm create` → `swarm query --sql @q.sql --seed-file urls.txt --refresh`).
  Sequential multi-page crawling with link discovery is `crawl`; periodic repeats
  are `loop` — do not use swarm for either.

**Pitfalls**

- `attach` and `open` share the session namespace: `attach --extension` fails with
  `An unnamed session already exists` unless you `-s <name>` or `close` first.
- A swarm session is isolated from default/named sessions and needs the
  `browser4-swarm` runtime plugin — without it the API answers
  `503 {"error":"Swarm not installed"}`.
- On a fresh swarm session the first jobs stay `queued` for ~30–60 s while the
  browser contexts boot. That is normal, not a stall.
- One `close` = one session. `close-all` closes all sessions and clears local
  state but leaves the backend running.
- Named sessions create one permanent profile directory each; there is no
  automatic retention/eviction.

## 2. Axis 2 — Display Mode

| Mode | Flag | When it is the right choice | Cost / risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HEADLESS** (default) | `--headless` (implicit) | AI agents, CI, Docker, batch extraction | More likely to be fingerprinted as automation; nobody can intervene |
| **GUI** | `--headed` | A human must act (login, CAPTCHA, scan a QR code); demonstrations; visual debugging; keeping a browser open for inspection | Uses the desktop; impossible in CI/no-display environments |
| **SUPERVISED** | `swarm create --display-mode SUPERVISED` / `displayMode` capability | Wrapping Chrome in an external supervisor process — in practice an Xvfb-based wrapper on Linux | Inert unless the supervisor is configured; see below |

**How the mode is resolved**

1. `browser.display.mode` in the server config (shipped default: `HEADLESS`).
2. The session's own display preference wins over the server default: an explicit
   `displayMode` capability beats the `headed` boolean, and both beat the server
   default.
3. `open` always sends an explicit preference (`--headed` → GUI, otherwise
   HEADLESS), so the server default in practice only applies to sessions created
   by other clients.

**Environment overrides**

- In an environment without GUI support (headless CI, Docker) the browser is
  launched headless regardless of `--headed` — the flag degrades instead of
  failing.
- The standalone MCP server (`java -jar Browser4.jar --app mcp`) has no Spring
  config, so `--headless` is the only thing that keeps it from opening a visible
  window; the last of `--headless`/`--headed` wins.

**`SUPERVISED` — read this before using it**

`SUPERVISED` does not mean "headless with a virtual display" by itself. It makes
Browser4 launch `supervisorProcess supervisorArgs chromeBinary chromeArgs`
instead of Chrome directly. Therefore:

- The mode only has an effect when a supervisor process is configured
  (`browser.launch.supervisor.process`, args in
  `browser.launch.supervisor.process.args`) — typically `xvfb-run` on Linux.
- If the configured supervisor binary cannot be located it is dropped with a
  warning and Chrome starts normally.
- `SUPERVISED` does **not** imply headless. On a desktop OS without a supervisor
  configured it behaves like GUI; in Docker/headless environments the launch is
  forced headless anyway.

**Headed-mode reliability and anti-bot notes**

- After `open --headed`, the CLI verifies that a visible window actually exists
  and warns when the session was launched headless anyway, or when the process is
  headed but no window is detected. If you see that warning, `close` and retry
  `open --headed` once.
- Browser4 passes plain `--headless` (never `--headless=new`), forces
  `--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled`, and leaves user-agent rotation
  off by default because rotation itself is detectable.
- Sites with strong bot protection may still block automated sessions. When the
  goal is "act as the logged-in user", prefer the attach paths (axis 3) over
  launching another browser, and consider raising `--interact-level` (§4).
- GUI mode is also the diagnosis mode: on shutdown the accompanied pool closer can
  keep the browser open and point at `chrome://version/` and `chrome://history/`
  so a human can inspect what happened.

**When there is no evidence:** there is currently no mode-specific implementation
for video/screencast, clipboard, or download behaviour, so do not promise
differences between headless and headed for those.

## 3. Axis 3 — Browser Source

| | Backend-launched (`open`) | `attach --cdp` | `attach --extension` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Browser | Chrome launched by Browser4 | any already-running CDP endpoint: Chrome/Edge/Electron/cloud | already-running Chrome/Edge **with the Browser4 extension installed** |
| Setup | none | remote debugging enabled in the target browser (`chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging`), or start it with `--remote-debugging-port=N` | install the extension; optionally set `BROWSER4_EXTENSION_TOKEN` to skip the approval dialog |
| Login state | whatever the Browser4 profile holds (or `state-save`/`state-load`) | the real profile you are using | the real profile you are using |
| Connection check | — | endpoint probed (`/json/version` + at least one page target) before binding; loud errors otherwise | session stays pending until the extension connects; pending connections expire after ~2 min |
| `close` behaviour | **terminates the browser process** | disconnects; **the browser keeps running**, but the tab Browser4 was driving is closed | disconnects the relay; the browser keeps running, but the tabs Browser4 drove are removed (`chrome.tabs.remove`) |
| If the connection drops | a new session can be created | **never silently replaced** — the command errors and asks you to re-attach | same, and a stale extension session is auto-reconnected once |
| Concurrency | one browser per session | several sessions may attach to the same browser | **one relay connection per browser** — a new attach tears down the previous one |
| Works in CI | yes | only with an explicitly started browser/endpoint | no (needs an interactive Chrome with the extension) |
| Best for | production batches, clean environments, CI | debugging live issues, cloud browsers, Electron, SSH-tunnelled remote Chrome | "just use my own browser" with zero flags/ports |

**`attach --cdp` — endpoint resolution**

`--cdp` accepts a channel name (`chrome`, `chrome-canary`, `msedge`,
`msedge-dev`, …), an HTTP endpoint (`http://localhost:9222`), a WebSocket URL, a
bare port, or `host:port`.

Channel-name resolution has three tiers: scan running processes for
`--remote-debugging-port=N`, then the channel's default port, then a scan of
9222–9333. **When the browser was started with `--remote-debugging-port=0`
(which is what Browser4-launched browsers use), the real port is discovered by
listing the process's listening ports — this tier is Windows-only.** On
Linux/macOS, pass an explicit endpoint (or start the target browser with a fixed
`--remote-debugging-port`) instead of relying on the channel name.

Attaching binds the session to an existing page tab of the target browser, so
subsequent commands act on the page you already have open.

**`attach --extension` — constraints**

- Non-debuggable pages (`chrome://`, `edge://`, `devtools://`, extension pages)
  are filtered out; navigating to a `chrome://` page can drop the WebSocket.
- Every attach creates a **new session and a new tab scope**: tabs from the
  previous connection are still open in Chrome but are no longer tracked. Use
  `-s <name>` to preserve a named session across re-attach.
- `BROWSER4_EXTENSION_TOKEN` only auto-approves the connect page; it is not a
  WebSocket credential — do not treat it as a security boundary.
- `--endpoint <server-url>` selects the Browser4 server to run against; it is not
  a CDP endpoint and cannot be combined with `--extension`.

**`SYSTEM_DEFAULT` profile mode is deprecated.** Pointing Browser4 at your
everyday browser profile no longer works with Chrome ≥143. To act as the logged-in
user, use one of the attach paths; to move authentication into a managed session,
use `state-save` / `state-load`.

## 4. Secondary Knobs

| Knob | Values / default | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| `--profile-mode` | `DEFAULT` (shared) · `SEQUENTIAL` (rotating pool) · `TEMPORARY` (one-shot) · `SYSTEM_DEFAULT` (deprecated) · `PROTOTYPE` (advanced) | Isolation vs state retention vs proxy rotation. `DEFAULT`/`SYSTEM_DEFAULT`/`PROTOTYPE` use 1 context and no tab limit; `SEQUENTIAL`/`TEMPORARY` rotate a pool. |
| `--interact-level` | `FASTEST` … `DEFAULT` … `BEST_DATA` | Selects an interaction profile and delay preset: higher = more human-like, more complete data, slower. The main "behave less like a bot" knob. |
| `--max-browser-contexts` / `--max-open-tabs` | swarm: 2 contexts × 8 tabs | Each context is a browser instance — this is the throughput/memory dial. |
| Browser contexts (server) | `browser.context.number=2`, `browser.max.active.tabs=8` | Global defaults for managed browsers. |
| Proxy rotation | `proxy.rotation.url`, only for `SEQUENTIAL`/`TEMPORARY` | IP rotation requires giving up the shared `DEFAULT` profile. |
| Browser channel | managed = Chrome; attach = chrome*/msedge* | Need Edge/Canary/Electron/cloud → attach only. |
| Platform | GUI-less envs force headless; sandboxed shells need writable `BROWSER4_RUNTIME_DIR` / `BROWSER4_CLI_STATE_DIR` | Determines whether headed is even possible and whether the backend can start. |
| Lifecycle | `close` (one session) · `close-all` · `swarm close` | `swarm close` also aborts pending tasks; forgetting it holds contexts and the worker pool. |
| Observability | `list` (Connection column shows the **actual** browser, flagging channel mismatches) · `status` · `screenshot` | Always confirm the real browser after an attach — driving the wrong profile looks like "lost login state". |
| Cold start | first `open` starts the runtime; first swarm jobs wait 30–60 s | Do not diagnose a cold start as a hang. |
| Per-session concurrency | commands on one session are serialized | Parallelism comes from multiple sessions/contexts, not from issuing commands concurrently to one session. |

## 5. Decision Tree

```
Need to drive a browser
├─ Need the login/state of the browser you already use, a live page, a cloud
│  browser, or Electron?
│  ├─ No debugging-port setup wanted → attach --extension [channel]
│  │    (avoid chrome:// pages; one session per browser; not for CI)
│  └─ Want a controlled/remote endpoint → attach --cdp <url|host:port|channel>
│       (on Linux/macOS pass an explicit endpoint; `close` leaves the browser running)
├─ Bulk, non-interactive, throughput?
│  └─ swarm create [--profile-mode TEMPORARY] [--max-browser-contexts N]
│     → swarm query --sql @q.sql --seed-file urls.txt --refresh
│     (browser4-swarm plugin required; always `swarm close` at the end)
├─ Parallel work, several tasks, or isolated state?
│  └─ one `-s <name>` per task  (dedicated profile; login state survives reopens)
└─ Otherwise → default session, `open --headless <url>`
   ├─ Human must act (login/CAPTCHA/demo)? → `open --headed`
   │    (display mode is fixed at creation: `close` or `--fresh` to change it)
   ├─ Want a throwaway environment? → `--profile-mode TEMPORARY`
   └─ Page withholds data from "robots"? → raise `--interact-level`
        (FAST → GOOD_DATA/BEST_DATA), consider headed, or switch to attach
```

## 6. Scenario Recipes

| Scenario | Session | Display | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Routine AI-agent automation | default, or one `-s` per task when parallel | headless | managed |
| Authenticated site with bot protection | `-s <name>` (keep the profile) | headed for the first login, else headless | `attach --extension` |
| Human-in-the-loop (CAPTCHA, 2FA, demo) | default/named | **headed** | managed or attach |
| Bulk extraction (hundreds–thousands of URLs) | SWARM | `HEADLESS` | managed (swarm's own contexts) |
| Debugging a live issue / user's session | `-s debug` | n/a | `attach --cdp` |
| Cloud browser / headless server / Electron | `-s cloud` | n/a | `attach --cdp <ws|url>` |
| CI / Docker | default | headless (forced) | managed |
| One-off clean scrape | default | headless | managed + `--profile-mode TEMPORARY` |

## 7. Limits Worth Verifying Before You Rely On Them

- **Named-session profile binding across a backend restart.** Named sessions get
  the dedicated profile directory `cx.<sessionUuid>`, and the CLI reuses a stored
  session id only while the backend still reports that session as active.
  The backend's name→UUID mapping is in memory, so after a backend/daemon restart
  a re-open by name may resolve to a *new* UUID and therefore a new (empty)
  profile directory. If login state must survive restarts, verify this on your
  setup or persist auth with `state-save` / `state-load`.
- **`close` on attached sessions** closes the tab(s) Browser4 was driving (see
  [attach.md](attach.md#close-vs-disconnect)); the browser *process* survives.
- **`PROTOTYPE` profile mode** is documented as the base for `SEQUENTIAL`/
  `TEMPORARY`, while the in-repo generator for it currently creates a default
  profile. Treat it as advanced/unverified.
- **Mode-specific media behaviour** (video, clipboard, downloads) is not
  implemented per mode, so no differences can be promised.
