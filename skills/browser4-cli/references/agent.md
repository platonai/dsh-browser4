# Agent — Autonomous Browser Task Execution

Submit natural-language tasks and let Browser4's AI agent plan and execute browser actions autonomously. Supports both asynchronous multi-step tasks (`agent run`) and synchronous single-page operations (`extract`, `summarize`).

## Prerequisites

Agent commands require an LLM API key, which must be visible to the **Browser4 backend server** process (the CLI only sends HTTP requests to the backend; the backend calls the LLM). When the CLI auto-starts the backend, set the key in the CLI's own environment before the first launch. Configure one provider via environment variables:

| Provider | Required Variables |
|---|---|
| DeepSeek | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` |
| OpenRouter | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_MODEL_NAME`, `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` |
| Volcengine (ByteDance) | `VOLCENGINE_API_KEY`, `VOLCENGINE_MODEL_NAME`, `VOLCENGINE_BASE_URL` |
| OpenAI-compatible | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL` |
| Aliyun Qwen (DashScope) | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL` |

```bash
# Set in the environment of the process that runs the backend server.
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

> The key must reach the backend server process, not just your CLI shell. Run `browser4-cli doctor` to confirm whether "✓ LLM is configured" on the backend.

If no valid LLM key is configured, `agent run` fails fast with a clear error.

## Quick Start

```bash
browser4-cli agent run "Open browser4.io and summarize the hero section"
# agent run prints a UUID task id (e.g. 3b27930e-48bc-4460-aae7-be521f0a9194)
browser4-cli agent status <task-id>   # poll until COMPLETED
browser4-cli agent result <task-id>
```

## When to Use

Use **agent** for natural-language tasks where you describe what you want without specifying click/fill/snapshot steps. Use **extract**/**summarize** for synchronous single-page LLM-powered extraction. For deterministic extraction with CSS selectors, prefer `htmlsnapshot get` or `htmlsnapshot query` (no LLM key needed).

## How It Works

`agent run` submits a natural-language task to the Browser4 backend, which uses an LLM to plan and execute browser actions autonomously. The agent reasons about the page, discovers elements, and adapts — it does not need refs or step-by-step instructions. Tasks run asynchronously; poll with `agent status` and fetch results with `agent result`. `extract` and `summarize` are synchronous variants that operate on the current page.

## Patterns

### 1. Asynchronous Multi-Step Task

```bash
browser4-cli agent run "Go to amazon.com, search for 'wireless headphones', extract the top 5 product titles and prices"
browser4-cli agent status <task-id>   # poll until COMPLETED
browser4-cli agent result <task-id>
```

**Writing tasks:** Describe **what** you want, not how. Good: "extract the top 5 product titles and prices." Avoid step-by-step ref-based instructions.

### 2. Wait for Completion (Optional)

`agent run --wait` blocks until the task reaches a terminal state, then prints
the final result. The wait window defaults to 600 seconds — long enough for
simple tasks, but browsing agents routinely exceed it. Tune it per invocation
with `--wait-timeout` (seconds) or globally via the
`BROWSER4_CLI_AGENT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS` environment variable:

```bash
# Block up to 30 minutes
browser4-cli agent run "Find a STEM toy for a 10-year-old girl on amazon.com" --wait --wait-timeout=1800
```

When the wait window expires, the CLI exits non-zero but the task keeps running
server-side. The task is still tracked locally, so `agent list` and
`agent status <task-id>` can pick it up later:

```bash
browser4-cli agent list          # the timed-out task stays listed as processing
browser4-cli agent status <task-id>
browser4-cli agent result <task-id>
```

### 3. Poll Status

```bash
browser4-cli agent status <task-id>
```

Returns JSON:
```json
{"id":"3b27930e-48bc-4460-aae7-be521f0a9194","status":"RUNNING","statusCode":null,"processState":"processing","message":"Navigating..."}
```

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `RUNNING` | Agent is actively working |
| `COMPLETED` | Task finished — call `agent result` |
| `FAILED` | Task errored — inspect `message` and `statusCode` |
| `EXPECTATION_FAILED` | Precondition failed (e.g., missing LLM config, status 417) |

### 4. Fetch Results

```bash
browser4-cli agent result <task-id>
```

Always confirm completion via `agent status` first — incomplete tasks may return empty or partial results.

### 5. Composing with Standard Commands

```bash
browser4-cli open https://app.example.com
browser4-cli state-load auth.json
browser4-cli agent run "Navigate to the reports dashboard, extract all monthly metrics, and summarize trends"
```

### 6. Synchronous Extraction (extract)

```bash
browser4-cli extract "product name, price, ratings"
browser4-cli extract "all article headlines and authors" --schema '{"fields":[{"name":"title","type":"string"},{"name":"author","type":"string"}]}'
```

**Output destination:** `extract` saves its result to a **timestamped file**
(`.browser4-cli/snapshot/extract-*.txt` under your working directory) and
prints only a link — it does **not** echo the payload to stdout by default.
Add `--stdout` (or `--raw`) to print the extracted content directly, or
`--filename <path>` to choose the saved path. When `--schema` is given, the
requested fields arrive as plain **top-level JSON** — both in the saved file
and on stdout — so `extract "..." --schema @schema.json --stdout` can be
piped straight into JSON consumers.

### 7. Synchronous Summarization (summarize)

```bash
browser4-cli summarize "summarize the product reviews"
browser4-cli summarize --selector "#content"
```

## Flags

| Flag | Applies to | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `--wait` | `agent run` | Block until the task reaches a terminal state, then print the result |
| `--wait-timeout <secs>` | `agent run` | Wait window in seconds (default 600; env `BROWSER4_CLI_AGENT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS`) |
| `--schema <json>` | `extract` | Enforce a JSON output schema for the extraction |
| `--selector <css>` | `summarize` | Scope summarization to elements matching a CSS selector |

## Errors & Recovery

| Symptom | Recovery |
|----------|---------|
| `agent run` exits non-zero | Check backend is reachable and LLM key is configured |
| Task stuck in RUNNING | Poll `agent status` — some tasks take minutes |
| Status/result returns unexpected payload | Inspect `status`, `statusCode`, `message` fields |
| Task lost after backend restart | Task IDs may not persist; re-submit the task |
| `extract`/`summarize` blocking too long | Use `agent run` for async execution instead |
| Agent subcommands in batch mode | Not supported — use standalone commands |
